Shaper Circuit Sensitive Analysis

Overview
This notebook presents the sensitive analysis of a shaper circuit used in the ATLAS experiment at CERN. The analysis aims to identify correlations between the output signal amplitude and the circuit components.

This project was developed as part of a scientific research collaboration with CERN scientists, focusing on improving the reliability of particle detection measurements in high-energy physics experiments.


Objective
The main objective of this study is to:

Investigate the influence of specific component variations on the output amplitude of the shaper circuit.

Quantify these effects through simulations and data analysis.

Propose circuit-level strategies to mitigate the output amplitude variation, improving signal stability in the ATLAS detector.


Context
The shaper circuit is a key part of the readout electronics in the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter. Any sensitivity in the amplitude due to component tolerances could compromise the accuracy of the energy measurements. This analysis helps identify critical components and potential redesigns or calibration approaches.
